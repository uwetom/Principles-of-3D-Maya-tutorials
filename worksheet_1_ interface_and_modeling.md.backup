# Worksheet 1 - Navigation and Creating Polygons
#### worksheet length  - 1 hour

### Before you start

- All the machines in the lab have Maya installed, if you want you use your own machine follow the installation guide.

- Make sure you have a mouse.


## 1. Getting to know Maya

### Create a new scene

- Open up Maya
- Create a new Scene

### Add a polygon

- Create a polygon cube

	![](images/worksheet_1/create_cube.jpg)

- This will create a new polygon cube in the middle of your scene.

### Navigate around the scene
 
##### On Windows 
 
 - The **Mouse wheel** zooms in and out

 - Hold down **alt or cmd** and **left mouse button** to orbit

 - Hold **alt or cmd** and **press the scroll wheel** to pan

### Manipulate the cube

- Click on the cube to select it

#### Move
- Click on the move button on the left side of the screen, or press **w** on the keyboard.

- Click and drag on the arrows to move the cube in the x, y or z direction.

- You should generally stick to the 3 coloured arrow never use the middle yellow square as this will move the cube relative to the camera.

#### Rotate
- Click on the rotate button, or press **e** on the keyboard 

	![](images/worksheet_1/rotate.jpg)
	
- Use the red, green and blue rings to rotate the cube in x, y and z planes.

- Never use the outer light blue ring as this will rotate the object relative to the camera.

#### Scale
- Click on the scale button, or press **r** on the keyboard

	![](images/worksheet_1/scale.jpg)
	
- Use the centre square to evenly scale the cube.

- Use the red, green and blue squares to scale the cube in the x, y and z directions only.

### More shapes

- Create a **cylinder** and a **cone**

	![](images/worksheet_1/cylinder_and_cone.jpg)

- By default the shapes have a low polygon count, you can see this clearly on the cylinder which doesn't look very round.

	![](images/worksheet_1/low_poly_cylinder.jpg)
	
- Delete the cylinder shape by selecting it and pressing **delete** on the keyboard.
	
- Double click on the create cylinder button, this opens up the cylinder options.

- Increase the axis divisions to 20 and make sure the rest of the numbers match mine.

- Press **Create** to add the cylinder to the scene.


### Outliner
- At the bottom of the left panel click the outliner button

	![](images/worksheet_1/outliner.jpg)

- This will open the outliner panel which which shows all the object in your scene.

	![](images/worksheet_1/outliner.PNG)

- Double click pCylinder and rename it to "body"
- Double click pCone and rename it to "nose cone"
- Rename or delete the other shapes as you want.

### Saving
- When using Maya save regularly to avoid loosing work.
- Choose **File > Save scene As.." 
- Create a folder on your network drive called "principles_of_3D"  
- Save the scene "worksheet_1_rocket" and save it.

### Grouping
- Hold down shift and click the body and nose cone in the outliner.
- Press ctrl + G to create a group
- Double click the group and rename it "rocket"

	![](images/worksheet_1/rocket_outliner.PNG)

- You can use the outline to select items that may be hard to select in the scene.
- Position the nose cone and body appropriately in the scene, scale and rotate them as needed.

### Increment and save
- go to File > Increment and save
- As you have already saved, you should now use Increment and save. This will create a new save file with a number at the end of the file name.

	![](images/worksheet_1/increment_and_save.PNG)

- Increment and save it very helpful as it allows you to go back to previous versions of your model.


### Centering
- It is important that your centre your final object so that it appears where expected when imported into other programs.
- The centre of your scene is called the origin, and is in the middle of the gird.

	![](images/worksheet_1/origin.jpg)

- To centre your group, first reset the pivot by selecting the group in the outliner and selecting **Modify > centre pivot**

	![](images/worksheet_1/center_pivot.jpg)
	
- Then move your object so that it is in the middle of the grid.

## **Final Challenge** - Finish your rocket

![](images/worksheet_1/rocket.png)

- Your Maya skills will improve the more you practice, for this challenge practice the skill you have learnt so far.
- Use cubes, cylinders and cones, and experiment with other primitive shapes to create a simple retro rocket.
- Name all the parts in the outliner.
- Group them all appropriately.
- You should be regularly moving the camera around your object to check it looks good from all angles.
- Get in the habit of saving regularly.
