# Worksheet 1 - Navigation and Creating Polygons
#### worksheet length  - 1 hour

### Before you start

- All the machines in the lab have Maya installed, if you want you use your own machine follow the installation guide.

- Make sure you have a mouse.


## 1. Getting to know Maya

### Create a new scene

- Open up Maya
- Create a new Scene

  ![](images/worksheet_1/new_scene.jpg)

### Add a polygon

- Create a polygon cube

	![](images/worksheet_1/create_cube.jpg)

 This will create a new polygon cube in the middle of your scene.
 
### Navigate around the scene
 
**On Windows** 
 - Mouse wheel zooms in and out
 - Hold down alt and left mouse button to orbit
 - Hold alt and press the scroll wheel to pan
 
 **On Mac** 
 - Mouse wheel zooms in and out
 - Hold down alt and left mouse button to orbit
 - Hold alt and press the scroll wheel to pan

### Manipulate the cube

- Click on the cube to select it

#### Move
- Click on the move button, or press **w** on the keyboard.

	![](images/worksheet_1/move.jpg)
- Click and drag on the arrows to move the cube in the x, y or z direction. 
- Never use the middle yellow square

#### Rotate
- Click on the rotate button, or press **e** on the keyboard 
- Use the red, green and blue rings to rotate the cube in x, y and z planes.
- Never use the outer light blue ring unless you have a very good reason

#### Scale
- Click on the scale button, or press **r** on the keyboard

	![](images/worksheet_1/scale.jpg)
- Use the center square to evenly scale the cube.
- Use the red, green and blue squares to scale the cube in the x, y and z directions only.

### More shapes

- Create a cylinder and a cone

	![](images/worksheet_1/cylinder_and_cone.jpg)

- By default the shapes have a low polygon count, you can see this clearly on the cylinder which doesn't look very round.

	![](images/worksheet_1/low_poly_cylinder.jpg)
	
- Double click on the create cylinder button, this opens up the cylinder options.

	![](images/worksheet_1/create_cylinder_2.jpg)
	
- Increase the axis divisions to 20.

- Press **Create** to add the cylinder to the scene


### Outliner
- At the bottom of the left panel click the outliner button

	![](images/worksheet_1/outliner.jpg)

- This will open the useful outliner panel which which shows all the object in your scene.
- Double click pCylinder and rename it to "body"
- Double click pCone and rename it to "nose cone"
- Rename or delete the other shapes as you want.

### Saving
- When using Maya save regularly to avoid loosing work.
- It is also a very good idea to keep your work organised
- Choose **File > Save scene As.." 
- Create a folder on your network drive called "principles_of_3D"  
- Nave the scene "worksheet_1_rocket" and save it.

### Grouping
- Hold down shift and click the body and nose cone in the outliner.
- Press ctrl + G to create a group
- Double click the group and rename it "Rocket"
- You can move items in and out of groups by middle mouse clicking on them in the outliner and dragging them out of the group. try this with the nose cone.
- You can use the outline to select items that may be hard to select in the scene.
- Position the nose cone and body appropriately in the scene, scale and rotate them as needed.

### Increment and save
- Go to File > Increment and save
- As you have already saved, you should now use Increment and save. This will create a new save file with a number at the end of the file name.
- Increment and save it very helpful as it allows you to go back to previous versions of your model.


### Centering
- While making your 
- It is important that your center your final object so that it appears where expected when imported into other programs.
- The center of your scene is called the origin, and is in the middle of the gird.

	![](images/worksheet_1/origin.jpg)

- To center your group, first reset the pivot by selecting the group in the outliner and selecting Modify > center pivot

	![](images/worksheet_1/center_pivot.jpg)
	
- Then move your object so that it is in the middle of the grid.


## **Challenge 1** - Finish your rocket

![](images/worksheet_1/rocket.png)

- Your Maya skills will improve the more you practice, for this challenge practice the skill you have learnt so far.
- Use cubes, cylinders and cones, and experiment with other primitive shapes to create a simple retro rocket
- Name all the parts in the outliner
- Group them all appropriately
- You should be regularly moving the camera around your object to check it looks good from all angles.
- Get in the habit of saving regularly

## In this worksheet you have learnt how to

- Create a new scene
- Navigate your camera around the scene
- Create polygons 
- Manipulate polygons
- Save
- The outliner
- Grouping 
- Increment and save
- Centering
