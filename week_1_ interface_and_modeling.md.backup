# Week 1 - Introduction to modelling in Maya

### Before you start

- All the machines in the lab have Maya installed, if you want you use your own machine follow the installation guide.
- Make sure you have a mouse, you can use Maya with a track pad but it is much harder.

## 1. Create a Robot

### Create a new scene

- Open up Maya
- Create a new Scene

  ![](images/worksheet_1/new_scene.jpg)

### Add a polygon

- Create a polygon cube

![](images/worksheet_1/create_cube.jpg)

 This will create a new polygon cube in the middle of your scene.
 
### Navigate around the scene
 
 On Windows
 ![](images/worksheet_1/windows.png)
 - mouse wheel zooms in and out
 - hold down alt and left mouse button to orbit
 - hold alt and press the scroll wheel to pan
 
 On Mac 
 ![](images/worksheet_1/mac.png)
 - mouse wheel zooms in and out
 - hold down alt and left mouse button to orbit
 - hold alt and press the scroll wheel to pan

### Manipulate the cube

- Click on the cube to select it

#### Move
- Click on the move button, or press **w** on the keyboard.

	![](images/worksheet_1/move.jpg)
- Click and drag on the arrows to move the cube in the x, y or z direction. 
- Never use the middle yellow square

#### Rotate
- Click on the rotate button, or press **e** on the keyboard 
- use the red, green and blue rings to rotate the cube in x, y and z planes.
- Never use the outer light blue ring unless you have a very good reason

#### Scale
- click on the scale button, or press **r** on the keyboard

	![](images/worksheet_1/scale.jpg)
- use center square to evenly scale the cube.
- use the red, green and blue squares to scale the cube in the x, y and z directions only.

### More shapes

- Create a cylinder and a cone
![](images/worksheet_1/cylinder and cone.jpg)

### Outliner
- At the bottom of the left panel click the outliner button

	![](images/worksheet_1/outliner.jpg)

- This will open the useful ouliner panel which which shows all the object in your scene.
- Double click pCube1 and rename it to "body"
- Double click pCylinder and rename it to "head"
- Double click pCone and rename it to "Hat"


### Grouping
- Hold down shift and click the head and the body hat in the outliner.
- press ctrl + G to create a group
- double click the group and rename it "Robot"
- You can move items in and out of groups by middle mouse clicking on them in the outliner and dragging them out of the group. try this with the head.
- You can use the outline to select items that may be hard to select in the scene.
- Position the head, body and hat appropriately in the scene, scale and rotate them as needed.

### Saving
- When using Maya you will want to save regularly.
- It is also a very good idea to keep your work organised
- Choose **File > Save scene As.." 
- Create a folder on your network drive called "principles_of_3D"  
- nave the scene "week_1_robot" and save it.


## **Challenge 1** - Create a Robot
- Your Maya skills will impove the more you practice, for this challenge practice the skill you have learnt so far.
- Use cubes, cylinders and cones to create a simple retro robot.
- name all the parts in the outliner
- group them all appropriately
- You should be regularly moving the camera around your object to check it looks good from all angles.
-  get in the habit of saving regularly

## 2. Create a low poly Trophy

### Create a new scene
- Select **File > New Scene" 

### Create a more detailed cylinder
- Double click on the create cylinder button to open the cylinder options window
- This allows you to choose specific details when you create a new polygon
- change the values as show bellow
	![](images/worksheet_1/new_cylinder.jpg)
- Press **Apply**
- move the cylinder up so it is sitting on the grid

### Faces, Edges and Vertices
- So far we have been manipulating whole objects. However, each polygon is made of different components that we can manipulate individually to give us more control
- The are **faces**, **Edges** and **Vertices**

### Modeling toolkit
- Open the modeling toolkit by press the button on the top right of the screen

	![](images/worksheet_1/modeling_toolkit.jpg)

- Select the faces button

	![](images/worksheet_1/faces.jpg)

- Click on an individual face on the cyclinder to select it ( you can also hold shift to select multiple faces)
- use the move, scale and rotate tools to practice manipulating the face just as you did with the whole polygon

	![](images/worksheet_1/move scale rotate.jpg)

- try to do the same thing with the edge and vertex selection modes, try to move, scale and rotate individual or groups of eges and vertecies.

	![](images/worksheet_1/vertex and edge.jpg)

- To go back to selecting whole polygons,select the button next button on the left

	![](images/worksheet_1/polygon.jpg)
	
- Delete your polygon by selecting it in the scene or in the outliner and pressing delete.

### Edge loops

- Go in to edge selection mode

	![](images/worksheet_1/edge.jpg)
	
- Double click on one of the lower horizontal edges to select an entire edge loop.

	![](images/worksheet_1/lower_edge_loop.jpg)

- Using and preserving edge loops in your models is very important for creating high quality models quickly.
- Scale the edge loop using the middle button to pinch the cylinder evenly.

	![](images/worksheet_1/edge_loop_pinch.jpg)

- Select the upper edge loop and evenly scale that in to make a trophy shape

	![](images/worksheet_1/upper_edge_loop.jpg)

### Add edge loop - multi-cut tool

- The multi-cut tool allow you to add more edges to your object.

- In the modeling toolkit, select the multi-cut tool

	![](images/worksheet_1/multi-cut.jpg)
	
- Hold down the cnrl key and left mouse button and drag you mouse over your shape. when you relese the keys a new edge loop will be created. 

	![](images/worksheet_1/create_edge_loop.jpg)

- Create three new edge loops to give your object more detail.


- You can quit out of any tool by pressing q on the keyboard, or pressing the arrow button in the top left

	![](images/worksheet_1/arrow.jpg)

- Scale and move the new edge loops to create a rounder trophy.

### Extrude faces - make a handle

- Press the face selection button in the modeling toolkit.

	![](images/worksheet_1/faces.jpg)

- hold down shift and select two faces on the edge of the trophy, it is important that you select the faces that are in line with the z axis. The Thick grid line should be in line with the faces.

	![](images/worksheet_1/select_faces.jpg)

- Press the extrude button on the modeling toolkit

	![](images/worksheet_1/extrude.jpg)
	
- Click and drag the blue arrow to extrude out the faces
	![](images/worksheet_1/extrude_arrow.jpg)
- Change the number of divisions to 3
	![](images/worksheet_1/extrudeing.jpg)
- Press q or press the arrow to quit out of the extrude tool

### Bridge the handle

- Select the 2 end inside faces on the handle

	![](images/worksheet_1/select_handle_faces.jpg)

- Press the brige tool in the modeling toolkit


- change the divisions to 





# make a trophy

- create a new scene
- Create a cylinder
- go into edge mode
- use multi cut to add edge loops
- quit edge loop tool
- select edge loops and rescale to make cup
- navigate aroud cup to make sure its symetrical
- go into face mode
- extrude out handle
- delete faces and bridge
- add base
- save

# stretch goal - make a retro rocket 
- make new project
- start with a cylinder
- multi cut to add detail
- rescale edge loops to create rocket shape
- add fins, booster rockets, windows
- group it all together and name evything in the hieracy
