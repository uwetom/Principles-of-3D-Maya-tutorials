    <h1>Worksheet 5 - More modeling</h1>
    <h3>Before you start</h3>
    <p>All the machines in the lab have Maya installed, if you want you use your own machine follow the installation
        guide.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.uwe.ac.uk/study/it-services/software/specialist-software#autodesk_maya">Maya instalation
            guide</a></p>
    <p>Make sure you have a mouse.</p>
    <h3>Create a new scene</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Open up Maya</li>
        <li>Create a new Scene</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/worksheet_1/new_scene.jpg" alt="Create new scene" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Save the scene</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Scale</h3>
    <p>By default 1 unit in Maya is 1 centimetre. This means that if you make a cube 1 high and import it into Unity it
        will be 1cm high.</p>
    <p>If you are making large objects, building or vehicles it can be useful to change the units to meters.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Go to <strong>Windows &gt; Settings/Preferences &gt; Preferences</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/worksheet_5/preferences.png" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on <strong>Settings</strong> and change the Linear Working Units to <strong>meter</strong></li>
        <li>Press Save.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Exporting for Unity</h3>
    <p>Before We export our model we need to do a few things to make sure it will import easily into Unity.</p>
    <h4>Save a fresh copy</h4>
    <p>First save your scene under a new name, this is because we will be making some changes that you you don't want if
        you need to edit your model later.</p>
    <p><img src="images/worksheet_5/save_as.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h4>Delete history</h4>
    <p>The history keeps track of changes you make to your model but it can make your file bloated. Delete it by
        selecting your model and pressing the <strong>Delete history</strong> button.</p>
    <p><img src="images/worksheet_5/delete_history.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h4>Freeze transforms</h4>
    <p>When making your model you may have scaled some of the pieces. Before exporting the scales all need to be reset
        to 1. To do this press the <strong>Freeze transforms</strong> button.</p>
    <p><img src="images/worksheet_5/freeze.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h4>Export as FBX</h4>
    <p>If we want to import our model into a different program the best format to choose is an <strong>FBX</strong>
        file.</p>
    <p>To export you model:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First make sure you have named and organised everything in your outliner.</li>
        <li>Select the object you would like to export and select</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/worksheet_5/export_selection.png" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose sensible location and file name</li>
        <li>Change the <strong>files of type:</strong> to <strong>FBX export</strong></li>
        <li>To make sure your textures are included, In the options panel on the right, under <strong>File Type Specific
                Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Include</strong> tick <strong>Embed Media</strong></li>
        <li>Finally press the <strong>Export Selection</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can now import the FBX file into Unity.</p>
