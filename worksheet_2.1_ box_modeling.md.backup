# Worksheet 2 - Faces, Edges and vertexes


### Before you start

All the machines in the lab have Maya installed, if you want you use your own machine follow the installation guide.

Make sure you have a mouse, you can use Maya with a track pad but it is much harder.


### Create a new scene
- Select **File > New Scene**

### Create a Cube
- Double click on the create Cube button to open the cube options window

This allows you to choose specific details when you create a new polygon

- Change the values as show bellow

	![New cube options](images/worksheet_2/new_cube_option.PNG)

- Press **Apply**


### Faces, Edges and Vertices
So far we have been manipulating whole objects. However, each polygon is made of different components that we can manipulate individually to give us more control

They are **faces**, **Edges** and **Vertices**

### Modeling toolkit
- Open the **modeling toolkit** by press the button on the top right of the screen

	![modeling toolkit](images/worksheet_1/modeling_toolkit.jpg)

- Select the **faces** button

	![select faces button](images/worksheet_1/faces.jpg)

- Click on an individual face on the cube to select it ( you can also hold shift to select multiple faces)
- Use the move (shortcut w), scale(e) and rotate(r) tools to practice manipulating the face just as you did with the whole polygon.

	![move, scale and rotate button](images/worksheet_1/move_scale_rotate.jpg)
	
You can undo at an point by pressing **ctrl or cmd** and **z**.

Try to do the same thing with the edge and vertex selection modes

- Try to move, scale and rotate individual or groups of edges and vertices.

- Select the button next button on the left to go back to selecting the whole polygons.

	![polygon button](images/worksheet_1/polygon.jpg)
	
- Delete your polygon by selecting it in the scene or in the outliner and pressing delete.


## Box modeling

For the rest of this worksheet we will create a very simple character using the box modeling technique, starting with a simple shape we will extrude out details.

We will create one side, and then mirror it.

- First create a new cube by clicking on the new cube button.

	![create new cube](images/worksheet_2/new_cube.png)
	
- Move the cube up so that it sits above the grid, we can think of the grid as the floor.

### Extrude a leg

- Select the face on the bottom of the cube

	![face mode button](images/worksheet_2/face_mode.png)

	![middle face on bottom of cube](images/worksheet_2/select_middle_bottom.png)

- In the modeling toolkit press the extrude button.

	![extrude button](images/worksheet_2/extrude.jpg)
	
- Click and drag down on the blue arrow to pull a leg shape out of the cube

	![extrude downwards](images/worksheet_2/extrude_arrow.png)

	![complete leg](images/worksheet_2/leg.png)

- Press **q** to quit out of the extrude tool

### Add a foot

Next we are going to add some more edges so that we can create a foot.

### Multi-cut

- In the Modeling toolkit select **Multi-cut**

	![multi-cut button](images/worksheet_2/multi-cut.png)

You can use this tool to add individual edges, but we are going to add a complete edge loop.

- Hold down the **ctrl or cmd** key and move your mouse over the leg of your character.

	![move mouse over model](images/worksheet_2/edge_loop.png)

- **Left click** to add an new edge loop.
- Press **q** to quit out of the tool.

We can now extrude the foot from the leg.

- Go into face selection mode.

	![face selection mode button](images/worksheet_2/face_mode.png)

- Select the face at the bottom of the leg and extrude it out as we did before.

- Remember to press **q** when you have finished to stop extruding.

### Arm

- Now extrude an arm in the same way.

	![extruded arm](images/worksheet_2/arm.png)


### Views

We are currently looking through the perspective camera which gives us a 3D view of the character, but we can also use the orthographic views to make selecting multiple components easier.

- Open up the 4 panel layout by pressing the button on the bottom left of the screen.

	![4 panel layout button](images/worksheet_2/4_panel_layout.png)

### Improve the shape 1

We can now manipulate some of the  vertices and edges to improve the shape.
- Go in vertex selection mode.

	![select front vertices](images/worksheet_2/vertex_selection.png)
	
- Draw a square around the front of the character to select all the front vertices.

	![select front vertices](images/worksheet_2/select_front_vertecies.png)

- Move them to create a better shape for the torso.

	![move front of model](images/worksheet_2/move_verticies.png)

- Do the same thing for the back of the character.

	![move back of character](images/worksheet_2/move_vertecies_back.png)

- You can now go back into the perspective view by pressing the button on the left.

	![perspective view button](images/worksheet_2/perspective_view.png)

### More improvements

We can manipulate the shape further by moving some of the edges.
- Go into edge mode.

	![edge select button](images/worksheet_2/edge_select.png)

- Select the top of the foot and move it down.

	![top edge of foot](images/worksheet_2/move_foot.png)
	
We can clearly spend a lot of time adding more edges and manipulating them to get an increasingly complex shape but for this tutorial we will stop here.

### Mirroring

Now that we have finished one half of our character we will mirror it.

It will make it much easier to model if our Character is centred on the grid, helpfully as we have not moved our origin cube it will be.

First we are going to delete half our model.

- Go in to the 4 panel layout.

	![4 panel layout button](images/worksheet_2/4_panel_layout.png)
	
- Go in Face selection mode.

	![face select mode button](images/worksheet_2/face_mode.png)

- Draw a rectangle around half of your model using the bottom left view.

	![draw rectangle](images/worksheet_2/select_half_1.gif)

- Press Delete

You should now have half a character

- Go back into perspective view.

	![perspective view button](images/worksheet_2/perspective_view.png)

- Go into object selection mode and select your model.

	![object selection button](images/worksheet_2/object_selection.png)

	![half a character](images/worksheet_2/half_character.png)
	
- To mirror, go to **Mesh** in the top menu and select the small square next to mirror. This is the mirror options.

	![mirror options](images/worksheet_2/mirror_options.png)

- Make sure your options match mine.

![mirror options](images/worksheet_2/mirror_options_panel.png)
	
- Press Apply

You should now have a complete character body.

### Make a head

Lastly we want to add a head.

We could extrude the neck and head out from the torso just as we did the legs and arms, however, in we want to add a circular head, it make sense to add it as a separate object.

- Double click on the create cylinder button to open the options

![create cylinder button](images/worksheet_2/create_cylinder.jpg)

- Set the properties to be the same as mine. make sure you tick **round cap**

![cylinder properties](images/worksheet_2/round_cap.png)

- Positions the new shape on top of the character

## Challenge - finish the character

If you want more practice, try to add some more detail to the character.

- Add more shapes such as eyes and a hat.
- Use multi-cut and extrude to add more detail.
- Move the edges to create a more interesting shape.

## Tips

- Double click on an edge to select the whole edge loop.
- When extruding, you can use the scale control to extrude along the surface.
